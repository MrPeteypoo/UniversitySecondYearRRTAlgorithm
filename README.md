RRT Algorithm
=============
In second year we were tasked to implement a rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm which would generate paths from a starting location on a map. This was the work I handed in for the assessment, it's an incredibly basic SFML application which loads a .map file and generates paths in real-time.
